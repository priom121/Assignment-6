       <h2 class="text-4xl text-red-500"> 1.Discuss the scope of var let, and const?</h2> <br>
       <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl p-4 "> = Var declaration globally , but const and let declaration blocked scoped. we can let variable updated but not 
        redeclare, const variable can neither be updated not redeclare & var variable can be updated and redeclare.
           when we are declare var variable ,they hosted from top of the scope and result back  undefined.
           let are const not initialized .

        <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl p-4  "> = Null in js means empty value and is also a primitive value. On the
          other hand undefined means the variable has declare but value is not assigned. So null
         variable has been assigned as null contains no value and undefined value is not assigned. 
                </p>
